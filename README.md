# Che4z

Che4z is an all-in-one mainframe extension package for developers working with z/OS applications, suitable for all levels of mainframe experience, even beginners.

Che4z offers mainframe application developers a modern, familiar and seamless experience, which helps to overcome some developers' reservations or concerns about the traditional mainframe user experience.

Che4z is powered by the open-source projects [Eclipse Che](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7) and [Zowe](https://www.zowe.org/). Many of these extensions, and other mainframe-oriented innovations, are also available as part of the Code4z package of extensions for Visual Studio Code.
